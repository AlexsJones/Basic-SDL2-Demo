This lib folder is only used for building a static executable, which means it doesn't need any '.so' or '.dll' files when the executable is run. In order to build a static executable, you need to install SDL2. If SDL2 isn't installed system-wide, you need to place any '.a'(linux) or '.lib'(windows) files into this directory.

You must have these libraries installed first:
on Ubuntu run this in the terminal:
	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2 libsdl1.2-dev libsmpeg-dev  libmikmod2-dev libvorbisfile3 libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libxxf86dga-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxv-dev libxinerama-dev libxi-dev libglew1.6-dev 

For the static-link script to work, 'make' needs to be run first, to generate the object files.
go into the 'src' directory and type
make

then execute the "static-link.sh" script.
./static-link.sh


Now in the 'PlaneOfCraftiness' folder there should be a file called poc(static)_<current date>.
