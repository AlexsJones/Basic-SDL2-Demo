NOTE
=====
You MUST have SDL2 to compile this game. If you don't have it first get
mercurial, then follow the README in the "lib" directory.


Installing the game system-wide isn't support yet, but you can generate
a application launcher '.desktop' file, which can be placed into
'~/.local/share/applications/' to be recognized by your desktop environment.
./generate_launcher.sh



How to build the Game
======================
Go into the src/ directory, and either execute "./build.sh" or type:
make

Then go back into the main directory and run the game.
cd ../
./poc
