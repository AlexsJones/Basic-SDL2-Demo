NOTE
=====
You MUST have SDL2 to compile this game. If you don't have it, first get
mercurial, then install system-wide. You can follow the README in the "lib"
directory. You do not need to install locally, it is more complicated.


Installing the game system-wide isn't supported yet, but you can generate
an application launcher '.desktop' file, which can be placed into
'~/.local/share/applications/' to be recognized by your desktop environment.
(Only works in Unix environments?)
./generate_launcher.sh



How to build the Game
======================
Go into the src/ directory, and either execute "./build.sh" or type:
make

Then go back into the main directory and run the game.
cd ../
./poc

Note: You must run the game from this directory so it can find the images.
