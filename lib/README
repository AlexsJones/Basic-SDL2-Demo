This directory should contain the library files needed to run the executable. If there is a poc_static
build you can run it without this directory. Otherwise you need to download and install SDL2(sdl-1.3).


##How to Install SDL2:
On Ubuntu, you need the following packages:
	sudo apt-get install mercurial build-essential autoconf


Then go to your Downloads directory and clone the sdl2 repository:
	hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL sdl-1.3
	hg clone http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL_image


Then go to sdl-1.3 directory to compile first.
	cd sdl-1.3/
	./autogen.sh


You can't build this library unless you rename .hg to something else, so type:
	mv .hg .hg1


There are two ways to install, the First one is easiest:
1. If you want to install the library system wide:
	./compile
	make && sudo make install
	mv .hg1 .hg

	##Now you are done.

2. Else, if you want to install to custom location you need to set your environment variable paths
NOTE: You neeed to modify the following absolute paths:
	mkdir /Path_to_custom_location/SDL-1.3/
	export PATH=/Path_to_custom_location/SDL-1.3/bin:$PATH
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/Path_to_custom_location/SDL-1.3/lib/pkgconfig
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Path_to_custom_location/SDL-1.3/lib


Then compile to custom location (do this for sdl-1.3 and SDL_image:
	./configure --prefix=PATH/TO/CUSTOM/LOCATION/SDL-1.3
	make && make install
	mv .hg1 .hg


##Once SDL2 is compiled and installed to your custom location
Go to /Path_to_custom_location/SDL-1.3/lib
Copy the .so files and place them into the lib directory in the PlaneOfCraftiness folder.
Now when you compile the game, it uses the SDL2 that was built on your system.
If you are compile a static version(for compatability across linux distros) goto the src/lib directory in the game folder.

How to install SDL2 on Ubuntu using PPA:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:(can't find one yet)
sudo apt-get update
